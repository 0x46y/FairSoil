# FairSoil Phase2+ Notes

This document captures ideas that are *not* part of the current on-chain scope.
It exists to avoid mixing implemented behavior with future concepts in README_ja.md.

## Phase2+ Ideas (Outline)
- APPI confidence weighting (anti-manipulation).
- Additional governance/incentive modules (QF/RPGF, forecasting, etc.).
- Extended UX/AI assist features (off-chain only).
