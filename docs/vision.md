# FairSoil Vision (Expanded)

This document keeps the broader philosophy and long-term direction,
separated from the current implementation scope in README_ja.md.

## Guiding Principles
- Honesty and fairness should dominate short-term exploitation.
- Core safety rails must be encoded (accounting rules, auditability, reversibility limits).
- Real-world constraints (law, force, geopolitics) are acknowledged as boundaries.

## Vision Summary (from README_ja.md)
- FairSoil aims to build a base where honesty is rewarded and exploitation is costly.
- UBI provides the right to refuse unfair work without risking survival.
- Socially necessary but hard tasks should be fairly incentivized by dynamic rewards.

## Premises and Design Stance
- Premise: resources and good positions are finite; competition never drops to zero.
- Stance: “the worst people always win” is a rule-design problem, not a law of nature.
- Externalization, information asymmetry, and survival fear are reversed via transparency, cost internalization, and UBI.

## System vs. Law (Boundary)
- Role split: FairSoil records incentives, disputes, and UBI; physical enforcement and property rights remain in real-world institutions.
- Law as oracle: court outcomes can be imported to update scores or state.
  - Only final decisions are accepted; ongoing disputes are held.
  - Format and signature verification are required for ingestion.
- Outcome: avoid dystopian total automation while retaining compatibility with real-world systems.

## Applicability and Limits
- Effective where law and consent function.
- Weak in environments dominated by coercion or force.
