# FairSoil

FairSoil is a decentralized Universal Basic Income (UBI) protocol designed to cultivate a "fair soil" where integrity and honesty are rewarded, rather than short-term exploitation or cost externalization.

## MVP Milestone (Phase 1)
- Date: 2026/01/14
- Completed: End-to-end tests across Token A (decay), Token B (asset), SoilTreasury, and Covenant.
- Verified result: Covenant approvals automatically trigger reward payout and integrity score updates.

## Scope (Phase1 / Phase2+)
**✅ Phase1(MVP) scope (implemented)**
- SoilTreasury (caps, circuit breaker, oracle hooks, UBI ledger, liabilities/reserves)
- TokenA/TokenB (decay/lock/circulating)
- Covenant (payment modes, 2-step resolve)

**🟡 Phase2+ ideas (not implemented)**
- APPI confidence weighting, governance/incentive modules (QF/RPGF/forecasting)
- Additional UX/AI support (off-chain)

## Identity (experimental core, adoption-friendly entry)
- **Tier 1:** Email / social login for read‑only onboarding
- **Tier 2:** Passkey (device biometrics) for limited access
- **Tier 3:** World ID or ZK‑NFC (government ID NFC proof, e.g., passport IC / My Number) for full benefits
- **Nullifier separation:** distinct nullifiers for UBI / voting / analytics
- **Device binding:** theft resistance with re‑bind on device change
- **Re‑auth conditions:** only on device change, primary address re‑bind, or high‑risk actions (e.g., expanding advance limits)

## Operational Notes (Draft)
- Evidence is stored off-chain; on-chain only keeps **evidenceHash**.
- report/dispute records include **evidenceHash** and a short statement; evidenceUri stays off-chain.
- AI summaries are off-chain, used for issue framing only (not decisions).
- Resolve uses two-step finalization and one-time appeal to reduce mistakes.
- **External adjudication plugin:** keep `disputeResolver` as a socket for external services (e.g., Kleros). Start with minimal local operation (single address/limited role) and route high-value disputes to external adjudication.
- **Adoption strategy (lightweight entry):** allow “view/try” before verification,
  then unlock benefits by identity tier. Start with practical pain points
  (e.g., attendance proof, local volunteering, anti‑scalping tickets).

- Event lists, audit events, unclaimed UBI reference, and on/off-chain boundaries are in `docs/spec_en.md`.

## Vision (Summary)
FairSoil aims to build an economy where honesty is rewarded and exploitation is costly.  
UBI guarantees the freedom to refuse unfair work.
