# FairSoil

FairSoil is a decentralized Universal Basic Income (UBI) protocol designed to cultivate a "fair soil" where integrity and honesty are rewarded, rather than short-term exploitation or cost externalization.

## Vision
To create a digital economic foundation where:
- Being "honest" and "reliable" is economically advantageous.
- Everyone has the "freedom to refuse" undesirable work through UBI.
- Socially essential but difficult/dangerous tasks are fairly rewarded through dynamic incentives.

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Dual Token System
- **Token A (Flow):** A "decaying" currency for daily transactions. 
  - Distributed daily to all verified humans.
  - Automatically loses value/amount over time (e.g., 30-day half-life) to encourage circulation.
- **Token B (Asset):** A permanent value store.
  - Earned through high-integrity actions and socially essential contributions.
  - Cannot be obtained through simple hoarding of Token A.

### 2. Integrity-Based Evaluation
- Rewards are based on "Integrity" (not just "doing good," but "not cheating").
- Penalizes "cost externalization" (pushing risks/costs onto others).
- Uses Proof of Process to verify that safety and procedural standards were met.

### 3. Sybil Resistance
- Integrated with **World ID** to ensure each participant is a unique human being.

### 4. Dynamic Incentives for Essential Tasks
- Automated reward scaling for emergency, high-risk, or essential tasks (e.g., disaster relief, healthcare) where supply is low.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Development Framework:** Foundry or Hardhat
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum L2 (Optimism / Polygon)
- **Identity:** World ID SDK
